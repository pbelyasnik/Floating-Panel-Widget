## Technical Details

### Architecture

The extension uses a two-script approach for security and functionality:

1. **Isolated World Script** (`content-isolated.js`)
   - Handles bookmark retrieval
   - Manages local storage
   - Runs in isolated context for security

2. **Main World Script** (`content-main.js`)
   - Controls floating panel UI
   - Handles user interactions
   - Executes JavaScript in page context

### Storage

- Uses `chrome.storage.local` for:
  - Cached JavaScript bookmarks
  - Selected bookmark index

### Security Considerations

- JavaScript execution is limited to user-defined bookmarks
- Content scripts are separated into isolated/main worlds
- No external script injection
- Restricted to non-chrome:// URLs
